        <p>I'm Louise! I'm a sophomore at Scripps College, and this is my website for my CS040 class at Claremont Mckenna College. This is a little about me!</p>
        <h3 id="fancyfont">Academics</h3>
        <p>I'm undeclared as of now, but am planning to major in either Spanish literature or anthropology. This begs the question: why comp sci? 
            This class is about the polar opposite to everything else I've been taking, and that was kind of the point. I'm considering a comp sci or data science minor to balance out
            my strong humanities focus, and also, comp sci is one of those disciplines that will match with whatever your interests are. The overlap between language learning and learning
            how to code has already been very impressive to me!</p>
        <h3 id="fancyfont">Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I've been sewing since I was little, and creative pursuits are very important to me. I love making my own clothes and modifying clothes from thrift stores. Also, reading! As you'll
            see, my other main page on this site is based around books. Reading became very important to me during quarantine, and it's a hobby I'm excited to keep around for my whole life. </p>
        <h3 id="fancyfont">Rapidfire Favorites</h3>
        <p><em>Favorite food?</em>Any thai food!</p>
        <p><em>Favorite song at the moment?</em>It's fall, so Vampire Weekend is really speaking to me, and I've been loving A Punk.</p>
        <p><em>Best outfit at the 2021 MET Gala?</em>It wasn't on theme, but <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37582218/kaia-gerber-met-gala-2021-oscar-de-la-renta/">Kaia Gerber's dress</a> was gorgeous</p>
